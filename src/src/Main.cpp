/**
 * Hey there,
 *  Welcome to the Void.
 *  I am Ábel (aka AdvancedAntiSkid) the founder of Void.

 *
 * What is Void?
 *  Void is a dynamic, stack-based c++ virtual machine and compiler that I started making
 *  for educational purposes. In my free time I always aim towards learning as much as possible,
 *  and once I thought how cool it would be to have my own programming language. Well here it is.
 * Why Void?
 *  Void's vision is to provide an easy, understandable programming language for both
 *	educational and production purposes.
 * How stable is Void?
 *  According to my testings Void should be pretty stable, but keep in mind that I consider myself
 *  as a c++ beginner, therefore I'm positive most parts of Void could be written in so much easier ways.
 *  If you have encountered any bug smake sure to report them on my discord.
 * Can I contribute?
 *  Sure. Just make sure to write clean code, follow the code scheme, and comment out everything.
 *
